# Flying Etiquette
I chose the question: In general, is it rude to knowingly bring unruly children on a plane? I picked this question since more often than not, one finds themself seated next to or near a rowdy child or on the opposite end, has to travel with their children and does not always prepare them to act accordingly. This question delves into a common dilemma of traveling with kids and their behavior on flights. Unsurprisingly, most people found it rude yet I noticed a small portion of people found it not rude at all-- one would assume that those selecting that option could be parents of rowdy children who have not been on the receiving end of dealing with disruptive behavior or perhaps they are empathetic people who understand that children are not always adherent to standards of plane etiquette with respect to noise levels or tantrums.
